# 🟢 Green Theme Testing Guide

## Quick Start

You now have a **toggleable green theme** to test the emerald green primary color from your landing page!

---

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`src/styles/green-theme.css`** - The green color overrides
2. **`src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`** - Toggle component
3. **`src/components/ThemeToggle.css`** - Toggle component styles

---

## 🚀 How to Enable

### Option 1: Add Toggle to Settings Page (Recommended)

**File:** `src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx`

Add the import and component:

```tsx
import { ThemeToggle } from '@/components/ThemeToggle';

// In your Settings component JSX, add:
<ThemeToggle />
```

This gives you a nice UI to switch between blue and green themes!

---

### Option 2: Direct Import (Always On)

**File:** `src/main.tsx`

Add this line after the design-tokens import:

```tsx
import './styles/design-tokens.css';
import './styles/green-theme.css';  // ← Add this line
```

This enables green theme permanently (until you remove the line).

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Add ThemeToggle to Settings Page

```tsx
// src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx
import { ThemeToggle } from '@/components/ThemeToggle';

export function Settings() {
  return (
    <div className="settings-page">
      <h1>Settings</h1>

      {/* Add this section */}
      <section className="settings-section">
        <h2>Theme Experiment</h2>
        <ThemeToggle />
      </section>

      {/* Rest of your settings... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Navigate to Settings

## 🎯 Key Differences Explained

### Original Blue (`#007AFF`):
- Apple's standard interactive color
- Familiar to iOS users
- Safe, conventional choice
- Blue = trust, professionalism

### New Green (`#10b981`):
- Matches landing page branding
- Unique, memorable
- Green = success, achievement (perfect for dog sports!)
- Modern, fresh feel

### Status Green Variations:
To prevent "sea of green", we use 3 different greens:

| Status | Color | Hex | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|
| Primary (buttons/links) | Emerald | `#10b981` | Main brand color |
| Checked-in (badge) | Lime | `#22c55e` | Brighter - stands out from buttons |
| Qualified (result) | Forest | `#16a34a` | Darker - feels "official" |
| Completed (class) | Emerald | `#10b981` | Same as primary (OK for this one) |

---

## 💡 Decision Framework

### Choose Green If:
✅ You want strong brand cohesion (landing → app)
✅ Green = success feels right for dog sports
✅ You like being different from typical blue apps
✅ The differentiated status greens look good to you

### Keep Blue If:
✅ You prefer familiar iOS conventions
✅ "Too much green" feels overwhelming
✅ Users might confuse buttons with status badges
✅ You're uncertain about committing

---

## 🔧 Making It Permanent

If you decide you **love** the green theme:

1. **Copy the values** from `green-theme.css`
2. **Paste into** `design-tokens.css` (replace the blue values)
3. **Delete** `green-theme.css`
4. **Remove** the ThemeToggle component

That's it! Green becomes the default.

---

## ↩️ Reverting

To go back to blue theme:

### If using ThemeToggle:
- Just click "Switch to Blue Theme" in Settings

### If using direct import:
- Remove the import line from `main.tsx`
- Refresh the app

### Completely remove green theme:
```bash
# Delete the files
rm src/styles/green-theme.css
rm src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx
rm src/components/ThemeToggle.css
```
