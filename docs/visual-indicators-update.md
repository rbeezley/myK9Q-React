# Visual Status Indicators Update

## Problem Addressed
Both "ready" (checked-in) and "done" (scored) dogs were showing green indicators, causing user confusion when comparing dog counts between "All" and "Ready" tabs.

## Solution Implemented

### New Color Scheme
- **Ready Dogs** (checked-in, not scored): **Blue** ðŸ”µ
  - Primary: `#2563eb` (light mode) / `#3b82f6` (dark mode)
  - Represents dogs that are checked-in and ready to compete

- **Done Dogs** (scored): **Purple** ðŸŸ£
  - Primary: `#7c3aed` (both modes) / `#8b5cf6` (dark mode)
  - Represents dogs that have completed competition and been scored

### Visual Changes Made

#### Status Dots
- Ready dogs: Blue circle indicators
- Done dogs: Purple circle indicators with subtle glow effects

#### Status Icons
- Ready dogs: ðŸ”µ (blue circle emoji)
- Done dogs: ðŸŸ£ (purple circle emoji)

#### Status Badges
- Ready dogs: Blue background with appropriate contrast
- Done dogs: Purple background with appropriate contrast

### Files Updated
1. `/src/pages/ClassList/ClassList.css` - Main status colors and indicators
2. `/src/pages/ClassList/ClassList.tsx` - Status icon logic
3. `/src/pages/DogDetails/DogDetails.css` - Dog detail status colors
4. `/src/pages/DogDetails/DogDetails-Apple.tsx` - Apple-style status icons
5. `/src/pages/EntryList/EntryList.css` - Entry list consistency
6. `/src/styles/mobile-optimizations.css` - Mobile status colors
7. `/src/styles/apple-design-system.css` - Design system badges

### Accessibility Maintained
- High contrast ratios maintained for both light and dark themes
- Clear visual distinction between states
- Semantic color choices (blue = ready/active, purple = complete)

### User Experience Improvement
- Clear visual distinction eliminates confusion
- Consistent color scheme across all pages
- Intuitive color associations (blue = ready, purple = done)
- Mobile-friendly indicators with proper touch targets

## Testing
Navigate to any class list page to see:
- Blue dots/indicators for checked-in dogs that haven't been scored
- Purple dots/indicators for dogs that have been scored
- Consistent colors in status tabs and summary displays
