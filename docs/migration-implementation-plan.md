- [ ] **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management, better TypeScript support
- [ ] **React Query**: Excellent caching and sync for real-time data
- [ ] **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid UI development with consistent design system

### Migration Strategy Decisions
- [ ] **Two-phase approach**: Minimize risk while achieving modernization goals
- [ ] **Database compatibility**: Preserve existing data and workflows
- [ ] **Judge-first design**: Prioritize user experience over technical convenience
- [ ] **Gradual transition**: Parallel operation before full migration
