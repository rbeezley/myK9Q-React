# myK9Q Development Plan
## Mobile Scoring Application for Dog Shows

### Project Overview
myK9Q is a dedicated mobile scoring application for judges to use at ringside during dog shows. It integrates seamlessly with the myK9Show management system while providing an optimized, offline-capable scoring experience.

**Key Goals:**
- Create a unified scoring interface that works identically on mobile (myK9Q) and web (myK9Show)
- Enable offline scoring with automatic synchronization
- Optimize for speed and accuracy at ringside
- Support both tablets (primary) and phones (backup)

## Technical Specifications

### Shared Type Definitions
```typescript
// Location: /src/types/scoring/scoring-types.ts
interface ScoringSession {
  id: string;
  judgeId: string;
  classId: string;
  showId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused';
  offlineMode: boolean;
}

interface CompetitorScore {
  competitorId: string;
  dogId: string;
  scores: Score[];
  totalPoints: number;
  placement?: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'scoring' | 'completed';
  notes?: string;
  disqualified?: boolean;
  absent?: boolean;
}
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Score submission
POST /api/scoring/submit-score
Body: { sessionId, competitorId, scores, notes }

// Get class entries
GET /api/scoring/class-entries/:classId
Response: { entries: CompetitorEntry[] }

// Sync offline scores
POST /api/scoring/sync-offline
Body: { scores: OfflineScore[], deviceId }
```

### Offline Sync Strategy
1. All scores saved locally first
2. Queue for sync when online
3. Conflict resolution based on timestamp
4. Judge confirmation for conflicts
5. Automatic retry with exponential backoff

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 90% of judges prefer myK9Q over paper scoring
- [ ] < 2 second score submission time
- [ ] 100% data integrity in offline mode
- [ ] < 5 minute training time for new judges
- [ ] 99.9% sync success rate
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents

---

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Network failure during show | Offline mode with automatic queue |
| Device failure | Quick switch to web interface |
| Data conflicts | Timestamp-based resolution with judge override |
| Battery drain | Power-saving mode, USB charging support |
| Learning curve | Identical UI across platforms |
