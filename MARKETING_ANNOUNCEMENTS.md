### Twitter/X Thread Template

> 🧵 Why do dog show judges still use stopwatches in 2025?
>
> Here's what we learned building @myK9Q - a thread on the unique challenges of dog sport scoring (1/8)

> (2/8) Problem #1: Multi-area timing
>
> In AKC Scent Work, you time 3 areas separately. Container: 2:45. Interior: 3:12. Exterior: 4:30.
>
> Try juggling 3 stopwatches while watching the dog AND marking faults. It's chaos.

> (3/8) Problem #2: Outdoor conditions
>
> Judging happens in full sun, with gloves, in remote fields with zero WiFi.
>
> Most scoring apps fail at the first outdoor trial. Paper becomes the fallback.

> (4/8) Problem #3: Real-time coordination
>
> Judge scores → Steward needs to know → Exhibitor wants results
>
> But everyone's on different devices, different apps, different timing.

> (5/8) Problem #4: Nationals have different rules
>
> Regular show vs National Championship = Totally different scoring logic
>
> Most apps don't differentiate. Judges have to work around limitations.

> (6/8) So we built myK9Q with:
>
> ✅ Multi-area timers (millisecond precision)
> ✅ Offline-first architecture
> ✅ Glove-friendly UI with haptic feedback
> ✅ Nationals mode built-in
> ✅ Real-time sync for all roles

> (7/8) The result?
>
> Judges score confidently at remote venues.
> Stewards see updates instantly.
> Exhibitors get push notifications.
> Admins have complete audit trails.
>
> All from one web app. No downloads needed.

> (8/8) If you run dog shows (AKC, UKC, ASCA) or judge competitive dog sports, check it out:

> Built by dog sport people, for dog sport people. 🐕
