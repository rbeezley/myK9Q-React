# Outstanding Tasks


## Test Pull-to-Refresh Mobile UX - 2025-11-20 ✅ COMPLETE

- **VERIFIED:** PTR improvements working correctly on production mobile. 20px activation threshold and increased trigger distance successfully prevent accidental activation during scrolling while still allowing intentional pull-to-refresh gestures.

## Scoresheet Refactoring - 2025-11-25 ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** All phases complete

**Summary:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Created `useScoresheetCore` and `useEntryNavigation` shared hooks
- ✅ Phase 3a: Refactored `AKCScentWorkScoresheet.tsx` (1,118 → 692 lines, **38% reduction**)
- ✅ Phase 3b: Deleted `AKCScentWorkScoresheet-Enhanced.tsx` (redundant dual-mode file)
- ✅ Phase 3c: Refactored `AKCNationalsScoresheet.tsx` (1,175 → 847 lines, **28% reduction**)

**Results:** Reduced 3 files to 2 files, **~1,550 lines deleted** (43% total reduction).

**Files:** See `docs/SCORESHEET_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` for full details. Hooks at `src/pages/scoresheets/hooks/`.

## Monetization Strategy Research - 2025-11-23 19:30

- **Research exhibitor monetization opportunities** - Brainstorm premium features and services that exhibitors would be willing to pay for to ensure app sustainability and growth. **Problem:** Need to identify viable revenue streams from the exhibitor user segment while maintaining value proposition. Current app is free but needs to explore sustainable monetization models that align with user needs and willingness to pay. **Files:** Consider researching competitive apps, analyzing user feedback in existing features (`src/pages/Home/`, `src/pages/EntryList/`, `src/pages/Settings/`), and documenting findings in new `docs/monetization-strategy.md`. **Solution:** Analyze exhibitor pain points throughout their show workflow, research competitive pricing models in dog show management space, evaluate premium feature opportunities (advanced analytics, training history, performance tracking, premium notifications, ad-free experience, priority support), and assess subscription vs one-time payment models.

## Consolidate IndexedDB Databases - 2025-11-28 ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** All files migrated to consolidated `myK9Q_Replication` database.

**Summary:**
- ✅ Created `prefetch_cache` store in myK9Q_Replication (DB_VERSION 4)
- ✅ Created [PrefetchCacheManager.ts](src/services/replication/PrefetchCacheManager.ts) with same API as legacy cache
- ✅ Created [MutationQueueManager.ts](src/services/replication/MutationQueueManager.ts) for offline queue
- ✅ Migrated all 5 remaining files:
  - `offlineQueueStore.ts` → uses `MutationQueueManager`
  - `offlineRouter.ts` → uses `PrefetchCacheManager`
  - `useClassListData.ts` → uses `PrefetchCacheManager`
  - `preloadService.ts` → uses `PrefetchCacheManager`
  - `autoDownloadService.ts` → uses `PrefetchCacheManager`
- ✅ Deleted legacy `indexedDB.ts`
- ✅ Tracked in [DEBT_REGISTER.md](DEBT_REGISTER.md) as DEBT-016

## Hide Debug Functions in Production - 2025-11-28 15:43 ✅ COMPLETE

- **FIXED:** Wrapped `initializeDebugFunctions()` in `if (!import.meta.env.DEV) return;` check at [entryDebug.ts:342-345](src/services/entryDebug.ts#L342-L345). Debug functions no longer register or log in production builds.

## Investigate Memory Leak Warning - 2025-11-28 ✅ FALSE POSITIVE

- **RESOLVED:** Heap growth (29MB → 44MB) is expected Vite HMR behavior in development mode. Memory detector only runs in dev mode. All ClassList hooks and useEffects have proper cleanup. No action needed - this is normal for active React development with HMR.

## Reduce Entries Sync Log Verbosity - 2025-11-28 15:46 ✅ COMPLETE

- **FIXED:** Wrapped sync log in `if (remoteEntries && remoteEntries.length > 0)` check at [ReplicatedEntriesTable.ts:148-150](src/services/replication/tables/ReplicatedEntriesTable.ts#L148-L150). No longer logs when 0 entries found.

## Fix MutationManager VersionError - 2025-11-28 15:49 ✅ COMPLETE

- **FIXED:** Root cause was `SyncEngine.ts` defining its own `DB_VERSION = 1` while `replicationConstants.ts` had `DB_VERSION = 3`. Updated [SyncEngine.ts:25](src/services/replication/SyncEngine.ts#L25) to import from `replicationConstants.ts` instead of using local constants.

## Reduce Individual Entry Cache Logging - 2025-11-28 15:49 ✅ COMPLETE

- **FIXED:** Replaced 647+ individual log lines with single summary: `logger.log(\`[${this.tableName}] ✅ Cached ${entriesToCache.length} entries\`)` at [ReplicatedEntriesTable.ts:189-190](src/services/replication/tables/ReplicatedEntriesTable.ts#L189-L190).
