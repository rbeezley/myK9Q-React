  // Track async action
  const handleSave = async () => {
    await track(async () => {
      await api.save(data);
    }, { dataSize: data.length });
  };

  // Get rage statistics
  const rageStats = rageMonitoring.getStats();

   - Metric list showing latest 20 measurements
   - Navigation timing visualization
   - Resource timing analysis

2. **Analytics Tab:**

### 6. Integration with App.tsx

Added automatic monitoring initialization:

```typescript
// Initialize monitoring on app startup
performanceMonitor.setEnabled(true);
analyticsService.setEnabled(true);

// Track initial page view
analyticsService.trackPageView(window.location.pathname);

// Send reports on page unload
const handleBeforeUnload = async () => {
  await performanceMonitor.sendReport('/api/performance-metrics');
};

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
```

Also mounted the MonitoringDashboard component for automatic visibility in Developer Mode.

## How to Use

### For Developers (In Development Mode)

1. **Enable Developer Mode in Settings** (Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode)
2. **Look for the purple Monitoring Dashboard** in the bottom-right corner of the app
3. **Click tabs to view different metrics:**
   - Performance: Web Vitals and resource timing
   - Analytics: Session and device information
   - Rage: User frustration patterns
4. **Refresh** to update all metrics
5. **Copy Report** to export data as JSON for analysis

### For Developers (In Code)

```typescript
// Track page view
analyticsService.trackPageView('/my-page');

// Track action with timing
analyticsService.trackAction('save_entry', success, duration);

// Track custom event
analyticsService.trackEvent('button_clicked', 'interaction', undefined, {
  buttonId: 'save-btn',
});

// Get performance metrics
const fcpStats = performanceMonitor.getMetricStats('web_vital.fcp');
console.log(`FCP average: ${fcpStats.avg}ms`);

// Get session data
const session = analyticsService.getSessionSummary();
console.log(`Session errors: ${session.errorCount}`);

// Check for rage patterns
const rageStats = rageClickDetector.getStatistics();
console.log(`High-confidence rage events: ${rageStats.highConfidenceCount}`);
```

  - Poor: > 4.0s

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):**
  - Good: ≤ 0.1
  - Needs Improvement: ≤ 0.25
  - Poor: > 0.25

- **FID (First Input Delay):**
  - Good: ≤ 100ms
  - Needs Improvement: ≤ 300ms
  - Poor: > 300ms

- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint):**
  - Good: ≤ 200ms
  - Needs Improvement: ≤ 500ms
  - Poor: > 500ms

## Real-World Benefits

✅ **Production Monitoring:** Track real user experience in dog show environments
✅ **Frustration Detection:** Identify UX issues before users complain
✅ **Performance Tracking:** Monitor Web Vitals automatically
✅ **Feature Analytics:** Understand which features are used most
✅ **Device Intelligence:** Optimize for actual user devices
✅ **Offline Tracking:** Measure offline usage patterns
✅ **Error Detection:** Spot patterns in application errors
✅ **Developer Tools:** Built-in debugging without external dependencies

## Performance Impact of Monitoring

The monitoring services are lightweight and use efficient event collection:

- Performance monitoring uses `PerformanceObserver` (native, non-blocking)
- Analytics batches events to reduce network calls
- Rage detection runs on event handlers (< 1ms per event)
- Dashboard only renders when Developer Mode is enabled
- All observers are properly cleaned up on unmount

## Next Steps

To integrate monitoring into your development workflow:

1. Enable Developer Mode in Settings
2. Use the hooks in your components
3. Monitor metrics during development
4. Use performance data to guide optimization
5. Set up backend endpoint for report collection (optional)
