### Settings Context Example
```typescript
// src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useSettingsStore } from '@/stores/settingsStore';

const SettingsContext = createContext<Settings | null>(null);

export const SettingsProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const settings = useSettingsStore(state => state.settings);

  return (
    <SettingsContext.Provider value={settings}>
      {children}
    </SettingsContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useSettings = () => {
  const context = useContext(SettingsContext);
  if (!context) throw new Error('useSettings must be used within SettingsProvider');
  return context;
};
```

### Migration Example
```typescript
// src/utils/settingsMigration.ts
export const migrateSettings = (settings: any, fromVersion: string, toVersion: string) => {
  let migrated = { ...settings };

  const versions = Object.keys(migrations).sort();
  const startIdx = versions.indexOf(fromVersion);
  const endIdx = versions.indexOf(toVersion);

  for (let i = startIdx + 1; i <= endIdx; i++) {
    migrated = migrations[versions[i]](migrated);
  }

  return migrated;
};
```
