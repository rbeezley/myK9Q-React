### DEBT-008: High Complexity Functions (RESOLVED ✅)

**Category:** Code Quality

**Severity:** Medium

**Created:** 2025-11-26

**Resolved (6 files):** 2025-11-28

**Location:**
- ~~`src/components/ui/OfflineIndicator.tsx` - complexity 45~~ ✅ REFACTORED
- ~~`src/hooks/usePrefetch.ts` - complexity 44~~ ✅ REFACTORED
- ~~`src/pages/Stats/hooks/useStatsData.ts` - complexity **86**~~ ✅ REFACTORED (extracted to statsDataHelpers.ts)
- ~~`src/pages/EntryList/SortableEntryCard.tsx` - complexity **64**~~ ✅ REFACTORED (extracted to sortableEntryCardUtils.ts + SortableEntryCardComponents.tsx)
- ~~`src/pages/EntryList/hooks/useEntryListData.ts` - complexity 59~~ ✅ REFACTORED (extracted to useEntryListDataHelpers.ts, 607→189 lines, **69% reduction**)
- ~~`src/pages/EntryList/hooks/useEntryListFilters.ts` - complexity 41~~ ✅ ALREADY ACCEPTABLE (no warnings at threshold 15)
- ~~`src/pages/scoresheets/AKC/AKCScentWorkScoresheet.tsx` - complexity 43~~ ✅ REFACTORED (43→26, **40% reduction**, used existing useStopwatch hook + extracted ScoreConfirmationDialog)
- Component/Module: Various

**Description:**
Multiple functions have cyclomatic complexity exceeding 15 (recommended max). Some reach **86**, indicating extremely complex branching logic.

**Impact:**
- **Business Impact:** Bugs in complex code are hard to reproduce and fix
- **Technical Impact:** Untestable, unmaintainable, error-prone
- **Risk:** Edge cases not covered, regressions likely

**Root Cause:**
Growing requirements without refactoring, lack of complexity linting.

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Added ESLint complexity rule: `"complexity": ["error", 90]` (prevents worse)
2. ✅ Added ESLint max-depth rule: `"max-depth": ["error", 8]` (prevents deeper nesting)
3. ✅ Refactored `OfflineIndicator.tsx` - extracted helper and render functions
4. ✅ Refactored `usePrefetch.ts` - extracted cache helper functions
5. ✅ Refactored `useStatsData.ts` (complexity 86 → manageable) - extracted 430 lines to `statsDataHelpers.ts`
6. ✅ Refactored `SortableEntryCard.tsx` (complexity 64 → manageable) - extracted to `sortableEntryCardUtils.ts` + `SortableEntryCardComponents.tsx`
7. ✅ Refactored `useEntryListData.ts` (complexity 59 → ~15) - extracted fetch/transform functions to `useEntryListDataHelpers.ts` (607→189 lines, 69% reduction)
8. ✅ Verified `useEntryListFilters.ts` already acceptable (well-structured, no complexity warnings)
9. ✅ Refactored `AKCScentWorkScoresheet.tsx` (43→26) - now uses existing `useStopwatch` hook, extracted `ScoreConfirmationDialog` component

**Effort Estimate:** Complete (all files addressed)

**Priority Justification:**
Medium - important for maintainability. Worst offender (useStatsData.ts at 86) has been resolved.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked By: None
- Related: DEBT-009

**Status:** ✅ Resolved (7 of 7 files addressed)

**Assignee:** Completed

**Target Resolution:** ✅ Resolved 2025-11-28

**Notes:**
- ESLint rules now prevent new code from being worse than current max
- TODO in eslint.config.js: Lower thresholds gradually: 90 → 50 → 30 → 15
- ~~`useStatsData.ts` with complexity 86 is critical to refactor next~~ ✅ DONE
- ~~`SortableEntryCard.tsx` with complexity 64 is next priority~~ ✅ DONE
- ~~`useEntryListData.ts` with complexity 59 is next priority~~ ✅ DONE (2025-11-28)
- ~~`useEntryListFilters.ts` (complexity 41) or `AKCScentWorkScoresheet.tsx` (complexity 42) are next~~ ✅ DONE (2025-11-28)
- Some files still have complexity 16-26 (above ideal 15) but all high-offenders (40+) are resolved
- Created reusable `ScoreConfirmationDialog` component for future scoresheet refactoring

### DEBT-009: Deep Nesting (up to 11 levels)

**Category:** Code Quality

**Severity:** Medium

**Created:** 2025-11-26

**Location:**
- File(s):
  - `src/stores/announcementStore.ts` - 11 levels
  - ~~`src/pages/EntryList/hooks/useEntryListData.ts` - 11 levels~~ ✅ REFACTORED (2025-11-28) - nested functions extracted to helpers module
  - `src/pages/Home/hooks/useHomeDashboardData.ts` - 9 levels
  - `src/pages/Stats/components/CleanSweepDiagnostic.tsx` - 9 levels
- Component/Module: Various

**Description:**
275 instances of code nested more than 4 levels deep. Worst cases reach 11 levels of nesting.

**Impact:**
- **Business Impact:** Slower development velocity
- **Technical Impact:** Extremely hard to read and maintain, difficult to test
- **Risk:** Logic errors hidden in deep branches

**Root Cause:**
Complex conditional logic, nested callbacks, nested JSX.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Early returns to reduce nesting
2. Extract nested logic into helper functions
3. Use guard clauses
4. Flatten promise chains with async/await
5. Extract nested JSX into sub-components

**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 days

**Priority Justification:**
Medium - readability issue that compounds over time.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked By: None
- Related: DEBT-008

**Status:** Open

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Target Resolution:** Q2 2026

### DEBT-010: Magic Numbers (887 occurrences)

**Category:** Code Quality

**Severity:** Medium

**Created:** 2025-11-26

**Location:**
- File(s): Throughout codebase
- Component/Module: Various

**Description:**
887 hardcoded numeric values found in the codebase without named constants.

**Impact:**
- **Business Impact:** Harder to adjust business rules
- **Technical Impact:** Unclear meaning, duplicated values, inconsistencies
- **Risk:** Changing a value in one place but not others

**Root Cause:**
Quick implementations without extracting constants.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Identify business-critical magic numbers first
2. Create constants files by domain:
   - `src/constants/timing.ts` - timeouts, intervals
   - `src/constants/limits.ts` - max values, thresholds
   - `src/constants/scoring.ts` - scoring-related values
3. Replace magic numbers incrementally

**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 days

**Priority Justification:**
Medium - maintainability issue, fix opportunistically.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked By: None
- Related: None

**Status:** Open

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Target Resolution:** Ongoing

### DEBT-011: Weak TypeScript Typing (SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED ✅)

**Category:** Code Quality

**Severity:** Medium → Low (after fixes)

**Created:** 2025-11-26

**Updated:** 2025-11-28

**Location:**
- File(s): Throughout codebase (~417 originally in production code)
- Component/Module: Various

**Description:**
`any` type usage bypassing TypeScript's type safety. Original count: ~417 in production code.

**Impact:**
- **Business Impact:** Runtime errors that could be caught at compile time
- **Technical Impact:** Lost IDE support, no refactoring safety
- **Risk:** Type-related bugs in production

**Root Cause:**
Quick fixes, complex external types, migration from JavaScript.

**Resolution Summary (2025-11-28):**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total `: any` fixed | ~111 |
| Total `as any` fixed | ~32 |
| **Grand Total Fixed** | **~143** |
| Files modified | 50+ |
| Remaining `: any` | 2 (in comments only) |
| Remaining `as any` | 0 |

**Batch Progress:**

| Batch | Files | Patterns Fixed | Key Techniques |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | 10 | ~15 | Proper interfaces, `unknown`, generics |
| 2 | 8 | ~13 | `AreaScore[keyof AreaScore]`, inline types |
| 3 | 6 | ~8 | `Record<string, unknown>`, union types |
| 4 | 5 | ~13 | Raw interfaces for Supabase joins |
| 5 | 8 | ~15 | Chart component typing, callback types |
| 6 | 5 | ~8 | Event handlers, hook return types |
| 7 | 8 | ~25 | Generic constraints, proper stores |
| 8 | 17 | ~32 `as any` | Window interfaces, type guards, API extensions |

**Key Files Fixed (Batch 8 highlights):**

| File | Pattern | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| `main.tsx` | Window debug | `DebugWindow` interface |
| `developerMode.ts` | Window exports | `DevToolsWindow` interface |
| `notificationService.ts` | Badge API | `hasBadgingAPI()` type guard |
| `performanceMonitoring.ts` | Layout Shift | `LayoutShiftEntry` interface |
| `ReplicatedTable.ts` | Protected access | `getTableName()` accessor |
| `SyncExecutor.ts` | Memory API | `PerformanceWithMemory` interface |
| `ReplicationManager.ts` | Optional cleanup | `hasCleanup()` type guard |
| `authService.ts` | **Bug fix** | `show.show_date` (was `start_date`) |
| `reduceMotionUtils.ts` | Framer Motion | `MotionVariantValue` type |

**Notable Bug Found:**
- `authService.ts` line 186: Used `(show as any).start_date` but `ShowQueue` interface has `show_date`. Fixed by using correct property.

**Remaining (Low Priority):**
- **Test files (~150):** Keep - mocking legitimately requires `as any`
- **Comments (2):** Future migration templates in `settingsMigration.ts`

**Applied Techniques:**
1. ✅ Replace `any` with proper interfaces
2. ✅ Use `unknown` for truly dynamic values
3. ✅ Create type guards for runtime checks
4. ✅ Use `as unknown as T` for safe two-step casts
5. ✅ Extend Window/Navigator for browser APIs
6. ✅ Add public accessors for protected properties
7. ✅ Use `Record<K, V>` for dynamic key access

**Prevention:**
- Type patterns documented in codebase
- Most `any` usage now requires explicit justification

**Effort:** Completed in 2 days (8 batches)

**Priority Justification:**
Low - production code now has proper typing. Only test mocks remain.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked By: None
- Related: None

**Status:** ✅ Substantially Complete (143 fixed, 2 in comments, 0 in production)

**Assignee:** Completed

**Target Resolution:** ✅ Resolved 2025-11-28

### DEBT-012: Long Parameter Lists (30 functions with >5 params)

**Category:** Code Quality

**Severity:** Medium

**Created:** 2025-11-26

**Location:**
- File(s):
  - `src/components/DogCard.tsx` - 12 parameters
  - `src/components/ui/CollapsibleSection.tsx` - 10 parameters
  - `src/components/ui/SettingsSearch.tsx` - 10 parameters
  - `src/pages/scoresheets/components/AreaInputs.tsx` - 9 parameters
  - `src/pages/scoresheets/components/TimerDisplay.tsx` - 9 parameters
- Component/Module: Various

**Description:**
30 functions/components have more than 5 parameters, making them hard to use and maintain.

**Impact:**
- **Business Impact:** Harder to use components correctly
- **Technical Impact:** Parameter order confusion, hard to test
- **Risk:** Wrong parameters passed, subtle bugs

**Root Cause:**
Organic growth of components without refactoring.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Group related parameters into objects
2. Create proper TypeScript interfaces for props
3. Use React context for deeply-passed props
4. Consider component composition over configuration

**Effort Estimate:** 1-2 days

**Priority Justification:**
Medium - improves developer experience.

**Dependencies:**
- Blocks: None
- Blocked By: None
- Related: DEBT-011

**Status:** Open

**Assignee:** Unassigned

**Target Resolution:** Q2 2026

**Notes:**
- `DogCard` with 12 parameters is highest priority
- Example refactor:
  ```typescript
  // Before
  function DogCard(name, breed, status, score, time, ...)
  // After
  interface DogCardProps { dog: Dog; scoring: ScoringInfo; display: DisplayOptions; }
  function DogCard({ dog, scoring, display }: DogCardProps)
  ```

## Resolved Debt Items

### ✅ DEBT-016: IndexedDB Consolidation (RESOLVED)

**Category:** Architecture | **Severity:** Medium | **Resolved:** 2025-11-28

**Original Problem:** Two separate IndexedDB databases existed: `myK9Q` (legacy) and `myK9Q_Replication` (new). This caused complex cache clearing on logout/show-switch, browser storage overhead, and confusion about which database stores what.

**Solution Applied:**
- Bumped DB_VERSION from 3 → 4 → 5
- Added `PREFETCH_CACHE` store to consolidated database (v4)
- Added `OFFLINE_QUEUE` store for offline mutations (v5)
- Created `PrefetchCacheManager.ts` and `MutationQueueManager.ts`
- Migrated all 6 consumers:
  - ✅ `usePrefetch.ts` → uses `prefetchCache`
  - ✅ `offlineRouter.ts` → uses `prefetchCache`
  - ✅ `autoDownloadService.ts` → uses `prefetchCache`
  - ✅ `useClassListData.ts` → uses `prefetchCache`
  - ✅ `preloadService.ts` → uses `prefetchCache` (with `metadata:` prefix)
  - ✅ `offlineQueueStore.ts` → uses `mutationQueue`
- Deleted legacy `indexedDB.ts` file

**Results:**
- **Before:** Two separate IndexedDB databases, complex cache clearing, 6 files importing legacy
- **After:** Single unified `myK9Q_Replication` database (v5), 0 legacy imports
- **Database Stores:** `replicated_tables`, `sync_metadata`, `pending_mutations`, `prefetch_cache`, `offline_queue`

**Key Improvements:**
- Single database for all persistent storage
- Simplified cache clearing on logout/show-switch
- Reduced browser storage overhead
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated managers
- No backward compatibility baggage

---

### ✅ DEBT-002: Legacy localStateManager Not Fully Removed (RESOLVED)

**Category:** Architecture | **Severity:** Critical | **Resolved:** 2025-11-26

**Original Problem:** The codebase had migrated from `localStateManager` to a new replication system, but legacy code remained with TODO comments stating: "Remove legacy localStateManager - replaced by replication system"

**Solution Applied:**
- All `localStateManager` references removed from source files
- Replication system fully handles all offline/sync use cases
- Legacy code paths eliminated
- No dual systems remain

**Results:**
- **Before:** Multiple files with legacy `localStateManager` code
- **After:** 0 references to `localStateManager` in src/
- Clean single-system architecture for offline data management

**Key Improvements:**
- Eliminated confusion from dual systems
- Single source of truth for offline data
- No risk of data inconsistencies between systems
- Simplified debugging and maintenance

---

### ✅ DEBT-001: Excessive Console Statements (RESOLVED)

**Category:** Code Quality | **Severity:** Critical | **Resolved:** 2025-11-26

**Original Problem:** 1,468 console.log/console.warn/console.error statements found throughout the codebase, causing bloated bundle size and potential data exposure.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added ESLint `no-console` rule with `warn` level (allowing console.warn/error)
- Configured ESLint ignores for non-production files (tests, temp files, edge functions)
- Added `eslint-disable no-console` for legitimate debug utilities (logger.ts, entryDebug.ts, etc.)
- Removed all console.log statements from 24+ source files
- Restored `--max-warnings 0` for strict enforcement

**Results:**
- **Before:** 218 lint warnings from console statements
- **After:** 0 warnings, strict enforcement restored
- **Files cleaned:** 24 source files
- **Debug utilities preserved:** 5 files with explicit eslint-disable

**Prevention:** ESLint `no-console: warn` rule now enforced with `--max-warnings 0` on all commits via pre-commit hook.

## Guidelines

### When to Add Items

Add technical debt items when:
- Taking a shortcut to meet a deadline
- Discovering code smells during development
- Identifying architectural improvements
- Finding missing tests or documentation
- Detecting performance issues
- Discovering security concerns

### How to Prioritize
